This project involves building a deep learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project is implemented in VS Code and uses a Streamlit app to display the results on the web.
<br>


#### Dataset:<br>
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:<br>
• Sepal Length<br>
• Sepal Width<br>
• Petal Length<br>
• Petal Width<br>
• Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)<br>

#### Project Overview:<br>

• Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for training a deep learning model.<br>
• Model Development: A deep learning model is built to classify the Iris species based on the input features.<br>
• Web App: The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input flower measurements and receive predictions on the species.<br>

#### How to Run the Project: <br>
• Clone the repository.<br>
• Install the required dependencies.<br>
• Run the Streamlit app to interact with the model on the web.<br>
